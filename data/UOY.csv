What should archaeological publications look like? Who should store and archive the information and artefacts once we have analysed them? This module will answer these questions and debate the considerable challenges involved. It will give you wide-ranging, advanced practical skills, as well as a deep theoretical knowledge and understanding of archaeology, whatever career you plan to go into. You will learn to think strategically about the analysis and dissemination of field archaeology data.
In recent years, many of the ills of archaeology have been laid at the door of poor management and inadequate forward planning. This module focuses on the relevance of this debate to the post-excavation process, considering these structures and procedures in relation to the analysis of stratigraphic and spatial evidence, and of artefacts and other material. In addition, it discusses the process of synthesis and model building, ending with a discussion of how the information which results can be disseminated to our various audiences, both by computer-based systems and via conventional mechanisms.
It should be stressed that this module is not intended to turn you into an expert on animal bones, pottery etc. What it is intended to do is make you aware of the analytical potential of the diverse data sets generated by fieldwork, the challenges that arise in unlocking that potential and making links between different types of evidence, and the ways this material can be archived and interpretations published to make all outputs accessible to future researchers.",,https://www.york.ac.uk/,https://www.york.ac.uk/students/studying/manage/programmes/module-catalogue/module/ARC00021M/2021-22,

This module is designed to introduce you to the basics of analysing buildings. We will consider the development of buildings archaeology and the current frameworks within which buildings archaeologists operate, particularly in conservation and heritage. We then go on to address the key approaches and methodologies in buildings archaeology; looking at archival research into buildings history, identifying key sources of secondary and primary sources that underpin both academic and practice-based research. We will familiarise ourselves with current professional guidance on standards and reports, including desk based assessments, historic buildings reports and heritage statements. The module will then go on to introduce you to the basics of analysing buildings, building your understanding of how materials, structures and architectural history can be used to visually analyse a series of case studies through lectures and on site practicals.

 ",,"Excavation is, for many people, the defining activity of archaeology and this module uses hands-on work to introduce you to all aspects of collecting, analysing and communicating fieldwork data. All of our excavation projects are driven by research questions and have resulted in substantial publications which have transformed our understanding of the Yorkshire region from the Mesolithic period right up to the modern day. The excavation experience is looked forward to by many students and is often the thing they most remember from their degree – not just for the technical understanding gained, but for the lasting friendships made.
This module is structured around a combination of introductory lectures, then hands-on experience on a designated departmental project, finishing with post-excavation work and an exhibition. In this way, it introduces you to all aspects of assessing, collecting and analysing primary excavation data, for many people the defining archaeological method (although it is really just one part of that whole).
In this way, we hope you will be able to appreciate how the process of reconnaissance and evaluation allows the development of an excavation strategy, and to understand the main excavation techniques, including recording archaeological features and associated stratification and taking environmental samples. Finally, after the excavation has finished, you will gain a grasp of how artefacts are sorted and cared for, environmental samples are processed and sorted, and the records made in the field checked.
This excavation element is looked forward and enjoyed by most students, something that many look back on fondly long after their degree has ended. Yet our excavations always involve a strong research element - we never excavate a site just for the sake of training students. So you will be involved in a project which will make a real contribution to our understanding of the past, and will help different audiences gain understanding of ‘their heritage’ into the bargain.

Everyone takes something meaningful from this module - and many students have come back in later years of their degree and affirmed they could not possibly have predicted the huge value of the concepts and ideas they learned in this first year module.
The module will introduce students to a range of theoretical debates and, through reading a combination of textbooks and original papers, students are exposed to the emphases, terminology and assumptions behind the various theoretical movements as applied to archaeology. Analysis of case studies, drawn from a range of regions around the world, will be utilised to help explain the development and application of various theoretical approaches. Case studies will be used to illustrate the impact of theoretical developments on archaeological practice and the subsequent implications this had for the development of the discipline both regionally and world wide.

 ",,"This module focuses on the wide array of post-medieval standing buildings and explores how they have been investigated by academics and what stories we have chosen to tell about them. How do we conceptualise modernity and how is this played out in the material culture of standing buildings? The range of buildings students can look at include domestic buildings (elite town houses, workers’ housing, country houses), leisure buildings (assembly rooms, shops, coffee houses, museums), civic buildings (guildhalls, town halls), institutional buildings (prisons, hospitals, workhouses) and industrial buildings.
The post-medieval period is associated with new forms of material culture and new ways of living. Early work by historical archaeologists focused on constructing grand narratives linked to modernity, with themes including the development of capitalism, improvement, rising domestic privacy, new forms of public space, separate spheres for men and women, the Georgian Order and industrialisation. More recent work has highlighted the need to explore the messiness and diversity behind these large-scale themes, utilising small-scale studies and biographical approaches to complicate these narratives. Students will be encouraged to explore these twin perspectives (national/large-scale models and in-depth micro approaches) through the standing buildings of the historical period.
The module begins with introductory lectures that provide an overview of the many different types of post-medieval buildings and some of the current research questions surrounding them. Students will then be guided through the process of choosing a seminar topic (whether a specific theme or type of building) and then developing it with a set of seminar questions and reading lists. ",,https://www.york.ac.uk/,https://www.york.ac.uk/students/studying/manage/programmes/module-catalogue/module/ARC00073H/2021-22,

With a topic of their choice, students will be expected to dive into some of the debates in the field and lead a seminar on their topic. Students say of this module that they enjoy the opportunities to discuss their topics and work with the module leader and with their peers.
Development of new biomolecular methods is currently opening up new sources of information and controversy about a wide range of archaeological issues across the whole prehistoric and historical time span of archaeological interest. The most interesting issues are those where different scientific methods produce contradictory results or where the scientific results are in conflict with other sources of archaeological information or established preconceptions. How these controversial or ground-breaking results are communicated beyond an academic environment to the wider public is also key to consider. All of this makes for a lively and rapidly developing field of study with a growing number of case studies.
This module will begin with a general lecture describing the structure of the Assessed Seminar. In the two following sessions the module leader will introduce some of the new developments in archaeological science, as well as a smorgasbord of recent ground-breaking and/or controversial research. This should encourage you to think of topics you find interesting that you may like to focus on for your seminar. In the remaining sessions we will hold roundtable discussions on your topics, as well as discuss tips and tricks for running a successful seminar and delivering presentations. ",,https://www.york.ac.uk/,https://www.york.ac.uk/students/studying/manage/programmes/module-catalogue/module/ARC00016H/2021-22,

Archaeologists have a significant contribution to make to these conversations. Landscape archaeology relies heavily on the use of evidence from the environmental sciences. Such evidence includes general models of climate change, palaeoecological evidence derived from palynology, land-snails, plant macrofossils and a range of other materials. Geoarchaeological evidence is also important: The study of topography, soils and sediments informs studies of landscape change; for example, how rivers changed their course, how coastlines either expanded or retracted, or how people have destroyed the soil system. This module will consider how these different forms of so-called scientific evidence can be incorporated with cultural evidence, such as settlement and artefact distributions, and can also consider theoretical perspectives, such as how people might have perceived environmental change in the past.
This module encourages students to consider how past peoples have been influenced by the environment and how people have caused changes in the environment. Landscape archaeology relies heavily on the use of evidence from the environmental sciences. Such evidence includes general models of climate change, palaeoecological evidence derived from palynology, land-snails, plant macrofossils and a range of other materials. Geoarchaeological evidence is also important: The study of topography, soils and sediments informs studies of landscape change; for example, how rivers changed their course, how coastlines either expanded or retracted, or how people have destroyed the soil system. This module starts with lectures and groups discussions where we consider how these different forms of so-called “scientific” evidence can be incorporated with cultural evidence, such as settlement and artefact distributions. We also consider theoretical perspectives, such as how people might have perceived environmental change in the past. 
After these preparatory sessions, students are guided in the choice of topic for their own seminar. Past students have taken two broad approaches. They have often taken one particular landscape or place, and looked at the evidence for changes in the environment and the use of that place over time. Another approach is to take a landscape type; such as wetlands, or flood plains, and to look at a range of case studies from different examples of that landscape type from around the UK or abroad during one particular period. For example, how Neolithic people in the South of England, Scotland and Southern France exploited flood plains. The choice of subjects has been incredibly varied, and as long as you consider how environmental evidence is used by archaeologists in the study of landscape, the choice of specific topic is down to you.",,https://www.york.ac.uk/,https://www.york.ac.uk/students/studying/manage/programmes/module-catalogue/module/ARC00015H/2021-22,

Though a separate species, they were the contemporaries of modern humans like ourselves in Europe for around ten thousand years and the interaction between the two populations has been the topic of heated debate. The archaeological record has been used to suggest radical differences in behaviour such as markedly different hunting practices and subsistence needs, differences in the use of space, and from within sites to landscapes to connections across regions, differing experiences of childhood and family structure and changes in the use of language, art and symbolism, even to deep-rooted differences in cognitive abilities that go beyond simple 'intelligence'.
How different were Neanderthals and why did they die out? In these seminars we will explore some of the evidence for Neanderthal and modern human behaviour at the transition, address some of the key questions and encourage you to decide on your own interpretations.
We will consider Neanderthals from several different perspectives - the evolutionary and biological, that of social relationships and that of cultural behaviours, and draw out potential seminar topics such as energy use, robusticity, reproduction, cognition, communication and language, childhood, technology, subsistence practices, art, mortuary practices community cohesion and many others besides.

What humans eat (and even what we feed other animals) goes beyond the biological need for sustenance and lies at the intersection between ecological, biological, social and ideological processes (e.g. status, gender, religion, wealth, the environment). Much of the efforts of our ancestors were driven towards the provision and consumption of food for survival but what they chose to eat provides a window on society and economy. The study of paleodiet has a crucial role to play in the study of any human society, underpinning some of the great debates in our discipline (human evolution, transition to agriculture, domestication, agricultural revolutions). We will explore the different archaeological evidence and methodologies for studying food provision and consumption and what they can tell us about life in the past with a focus on scientific approaches. 
Once regarded as a rather unexciting field of study associated with basic subsistence, palaeodietary studies have been rejuvenated in recent years both by new scientific methods and new theoretical perspectives. The food that people eat actually stands at the intersection between ecological, biological, social and ideological processes, and provides a rich source of evidence with which to view these different perspectives on human action and their complex inter-relationship. Palaeodietary studies involve a consideration of the food remains recovered from archaeological deposits and issues of taphonomy, differential preservation and seasonality, biological factors associated with nutrition and metabolism and the information on diet that can be recovered from human skeletal remains, ecological factors associated with food production and with changes in food production such as domestication and agriculture, and social and ideological factors associated with food consumption practices and food taboos.
In a series of lectures and workshops, students will become familiar with the different archaeological evidence and methodologies for studying food provision and consumption and what they can tell us about the past. Students will then choose and develop a topic around which they will design and chair a seminar. Seminars and class discussion will encourage a critical approach to the study of paleodiet.

We will explore what heritage is, why it matters, how we manage and protect it, along with various controversies like whether modern values apply to the past, we can be neutral in modern conflicts over heritage and if curated decay is a viable option for heritage management. Students will be encouraged to develop their critical thinking about all these issues.
We will begin by exploring how we define and create heritage before looking at the values we say that it has for people today. Once we understand this then we will take a look at how heritage is managed and protected. One aspect of this that we will cover is that of modern and contemporary heritage from the 20th and 21st centuries. This will lead us into thinking about aspects of heritage that tend to be ignored in the UK, such as intangible heritage and the heritage of the future. We will also look at heritage controversies (the toppling of the Colston statue in Bristol, the destruction of Palmyra in Syria and the National Trust’s managed decay at the site of Orford Ness.

Sessions are taught in conjunction with local archives, and utilise their collections of historic documents, pictures and maps. The module initially considers the skills required to effectively utilise archival sources, from how to locate records, to how to read and transcribe their contents (palaeography). 
The module is structured around three key groups of resources and is focused on considering their purpose, content, and analysis and interpretation. Sessions on Ecclesiastical Records explore the huge range of archival material produced and collected by Church authorities across the medieval and post medieval periods, both those related to churches themselves, and the wider landscapes and buildings they controlled. The module then turns its attention to Domestic and Urban records, exploring the records of everyday life in a city like York.

By working as part of this wider project team, the ‘heritage practitioners’ will be given hands-on experience of heritage tasks and practices such as desk-based and archival research, and public presentation. Students have found that this module increases their understanding of public engagement in archaeology and helps with their confidence in communicating with a variety of audiences.
Archaeologists depend upon the support and buy-in of a variety of stakeholders to sustain our practice.  Similarly, archaeology offers its audiences opportunities for sustainable historic, intellectual, cultural, spiritual, and political—among other—connections to the surrounding world. 
Aligned with the Excavation module, Heritage Practitioners will be embedded in the departmental field school and be expected to do most of the tasks that the rest fo the 1st Year cohort are engaged with upon that module.
 
However, the Heritage Practice students will take time away from excavation to organised tours of the site for the general public and help curate stories of the excavation and its interpretation for wider audiences. We will consider how archaeology and cultural heritage are mobilised via different forms of media. How do such media help, for example, in promoting understanding, garnering public support, furthering research and encouraging participation? We will also consider the role of museums and their varied interpretative practice in the modern world. Our interest is not only in the use of exhibitions/interpretative media for promoting the past to the public, but also in their efficacy for adding to our archaeological theoretical frameworks and furthering our research agendas.",,https://www.york.ac.uk/,https://www.york.ac.uk/students/studying/manage/programmes/module-catalogue/module/ARC00007C/2021-22,

This is an optional module, part of the suite of Spring Term practical modules. It has a companion Team Project which will run in the Summer Term.
This module provides a short refresher on the data capture, with three outdoor sessions, but focuses primarily on what we can do with that data and what it can tell us. Throughout the term you will get practical experience of processing geophysical data and performing basic LiDAR analysis. We will focus on how to interpret what we find from both geophysical and landscape survey, and present those data and interpretations using a digital drawing package, for inclusion in project reports. 
The formative assessment will provide experience of critiquing published reports on the subject. A similar summative assessment will be submitted at the end of term, along with a class test which will assess the students knowledge of landscape and geophysical features and methods, as well as their interpretative skills.",,https://www.york.ac.uk/,https://www.york.ac.uk/students/studying/manage/programmes/module-catalogue/module/ARC00059I/2021-22,

The module will also explore how easily the evidence can be misused in modern political debates about identity and belonging, and challenge you to suggest your own interpretations.
The lectures and seminars will take a thematic approach, exploring an issue relating to funerary archaeology in later prehistory through comparing and contrasting different cases studies. Drawing on a range of evidence from across Europe, we will explore the application of ethnography to interpret death and burial; landscapes and monuments; identities and grave goods; treatment of the body from inhumation, cremation, to disarticulation and secondary burial rites; ancient DNA and isotopic studies; social inequalities and structures; and the evidence for deviant burial rites. Case studies will come from the Neolithic to the Iron Age, introducing you to the major sites and types of evidence found, found from the iconic monuments of Neolithic Britain to the Iron Age Bog Bodies of the Iron Age.

 ",,"This module brings together the academic study of historic house interiors with contemporary heritage interpretation and conservation. How are these interiors interpreted to the public? What stories do we choose to tell and are there other stories (particularly revolving around marginalised social groups) that would be more inclusive and engaging? How do we balance the need to conserve these historic houses with the need to generate revenue and keep them open? How have different disciples (archaeology, art history, history) explored these houses in different ways? 
Students have said that ‘Matt Jenkins is an excellent teacher, he has a genuine love for the material he is teaching and I only wish I had another module with him.’ Matt’s ‘passion for historic buildings is very apparent in the way he teaches’ and ‘The course has been incredibly fun and useful’. 
We follow two strands in this module. The first provides a broad overview of the major themes, including:
What are the different sources we can use to investigate historic interiors? 
What is the current heritage climate for historic house museums? How are different interpretive methods used in these museums, such as costumed interpretation and digital heritage?

We will find that the story of our evolutionary origins is more complex, more chaotic and more surprising than we might imagine – there has never been any goal or intention, and multiple species of hominin and many different branches have been the norm for most of our evolutionary past.
Starting from our last common ancestor with other apes living around 7-8 million years ago we will look at the evolutionary processes which created and changed our bodies and minds over millions of years and how we as humans and human culture emerged. We draw on a range of evidence from the archaeological to anatomical to comparative primatology and on a range of disciplines to build up our understanding of our origins. Who is ‘nutcracker man’? Why are we bipedal? Are humans domesticated? What are the evolutionary explanations for art or mortuary practices? In this module we hope to address some of these questions as well as many others. 
We start with the basics of evolutionary theory and with historical approaches to human origins before considering our evolutionary past from a chronological perspective. We begin with our evolutionary history as primates and the influence this has on our minds and bodies, before moving on to some of the earliest human ancestors, australopithecines, the emergence of the genus Homo and onto archaic and modern humans. We cover key topics including interpretations of stone tools, the evolution of cognition, the evolution of social and cultural behaviours and special issues such as alternative pathways and domestication.

 ",,"Today, many of us see the Mediterranean as a holiday destination - from the beaches of Spain to boat trips around the Greek islands and visits to the great Classical cities such as Rome and Athens. European farming has its origins in the Mediterranean. Once established, the origins of metalworking and complex societies also developed in and spread from this region. After the Minoan and Mycenaean periods, the great Classical civilisations and empires developed; the obvious examples are Greece and Rome. This module provides an overview of the development of all of these societies and emphasises the importance of interdisciplinary work in investigating Mediterranean archaeology.
The Mediterranean is home to the most famous ancient civilisations, including the Greeks and Romans. This region comprises complex environmental and human histories; in many ways, both have been dynamic and unstable, but with periods of periods relative stability when infamous cultures and civilisations have developed.
The module will build upon some of the themes covered in Prehistory to the Present (hunter-gatherers, the transition to farming, the development of the Roman world). We will start with an overview of the Mediterranean landscape and environment, as well as the main methodological approaches. We then consider the end of hunter-gatherer societies followed by an assessment of the transition to farming -  This is followed by a review of the great Bronze Age cultures of the Minoans and the Mycenaeans, to name two. We then consider the Iron Age, the Etruscans, the Phoenicians, and other groups then dominated much of the region, and we will consider some key developments in these areas.
Throughout the module, we will consider how these different groups developed their economies and their religious and ideological systems. Just as importantly, we will also assess how these peoples related to and engaged with the incredible range of natural environments that characterise the Mediterranean. The module adopts a ""landscape approach"" assessing the background to the development of Mediterranean landscapes and then considering how people have exploited and managed their environments from the prehistoric periods through to the Roman Empire.

In this module, we will explore the archaeology of the Viking homelands, from the arctic to the shores of the Baltic. We will draw on a range of evidence to learn about all aspects of Viking-Age society: religion, power, warfare, everyday rural life, the emergence of towns, craft, trade, long-distance travel, and more. This was a period of extraordinary change, and we’ll try to think about what that would have meant for the people living through it, whether they be men or women, kings or slaves. The introduction of this module was greeted with much excitement, and Steve’s Vikings teaching has been described as ‘wonderful and intellectually stimulating’ and offering a ‘refreshing perspective’.
The most common imagining of the Viking Age is as a period of barbarism and violence, piracy and larceny, slave-taking and extortion. But how did the period look in the home of the ‘vikings’ themselves? In many ways this was a formative period of Scandinavian state development: it saw the growth of towns, the expansion of overseas trade, and the rise of royal power. In this module, we will explore these diverse elements of Scandinavia’s social and economic environment, and attempt to reconcile them. We will attempt to recognise some of the diversity across the region: Scandinavia was not a single unified state at war with the rest of Europe, but host to a range of complex and dynamic social milieux, negotiating diverse responses to the problems of inhabiting their world.  We will consider the following questions:
-What was the Viking Age? Why did it happen?
-How was power structured and expressed in Viking-Age Scandinavia?
-How was this rural landscape of power disrupted or supported by the appearance of towns?
-How did communities separated by many miles of land and sea communicate with one another?",,https://www.york.ac.uk/,https://www.york.ac.uk/students/studying/manage/programmes/module-catalogue/module/ARC00076H/2021-22,

We begin by looking at the origins of resilience theory within ecology and the rejection of the idea that ecosystems exist in equilibrium; moving on to note parallels and contrasts between resilience theory, supply-side sustainability, and the notion that sustainable development can be achieved by leaning from the ‘indigenous knowledge’ of societies in the past and present. From here we will look at attempts to combine these ecological and human perspectives through the concepts of socio-ecological systems and human ecodynamics, noting the strengths and weaknesses of these highly interdisciplinary approaches.

Students on this course said, “The Team project made me realise that I have learned new skills this year not just in research but also organising my time and working with others. I really enjoyed being able to focus on the aspects of the project that interested me and helped me contribute to the team effort and group mark.”
This module builds on your experience last term, exploring how archaeologists have used archival sources in the study of buildings, to produce your own building history report. You will identify a building together, thinking carefully about its potential to be studied through surviving archival sources. Together, you will agree the areas of the research and report writing required, including secondary reading, analysis and interpretation of the sources themselves, report writing, referencing, editing and illustration. You will agree a timetable for the work and meet regularly to share findings and ideas. The final report will reflect successful team working and negotiation of any challenges you encountered, professionally and personally as a valuable learning experience to take to future learning experiences and workplace environments. Support throughout the module will be given by module and group sessions with the tutor. ",,https://www.york.ac.uk/,https://www.york.ac.uk/students/studying/manage/programmes/module-catalogue/module/ARC00026I/2021-22,

The practical elements of the course will work with a single set of archaeological data from the outset, selected from the ADS. Each workshop will include a short presentation on the week's theme as well as time for exercises and activities. Exercises will gradually build in complexity from week to week, and the assessment will be developed cumulatively as students develop their ideas in class and as part of their weekly private study.",,https://www.york.ac.uk/,https://www.york.ac.uk/students/studying/manage/programmes/module-catalogue/module/ARC00036M/2021-22,

Examples of wicked problems include crime, health, social injustice and environmental pollution.
 
In his 1977 book ‘The Moon and the Ghetto’, the economist Richard Nelson asked why innovation has resulted in such difficult feats as landing a man on the moon yet continues to struggle to resolve the more immediate problems of poverty, illiteracy, and the emergence of ghettos and slums. He concludes that, while politics is partly to blame, the real difficulty is that these ‘wicked’ problems demand solutions which are complex, multi-disciplinary and creative and that such solutions are often difficult to design, fund and implement. 
 
This module promotes the idea that, done well, archaeology can contribute to these solutions by being socially and politically engaged with contemporary issues. Simply, the module asks the question: ‘How can archaeology contribute to shaping a better world?’
Each class will involve a 30 min recorded lecture to introduce key concepts and a case study or two. This will be developed through a 1 hr discussion/debate on these concepts and case studies. Students will prepare weekly tasks considering the specific problem and ways that archaeology and heritage might provide possible solutions. Students will also be asked to explore the wider literature and online sources to identify further examples where archaeology could be applied to a wicked problem.

This module will adopt a holistic approach, considering human-environment interactions from the Mesolithic to the Post Medieval period in the Alps. For each period, we also address questions relating to ritual and ideology and the ways in which these processes might have influenced the organisation or perception of alpine landscapes.
While there is a long history of research at lower altitudes across the European Alps, research in Europe’s most important mountain range has suffered from a lack of work in the higher-altitude zones. The last two decades have witnessed a significant increase in higher altitude research, thus helping us complete the picture of how these complex landscapes developed over time. This module will present a chronological overview of activity in the Alps from the Mesolithic through to the post-medieval period. After reviewing the complexity of hunting and gathering in alpine environments, the module will then consider evidence for the movement of farmers into the alpine valleys and the gradual incursions into the higher altitudinal zones. Moving into the chalcolithic, we will consider what Otzi, the “Ice Mummy”, tells us about life in the Alps at this time. Around the edges of the Alps, the world-famous lake villages were established during this period, and many were inhabited into the Iron Age.  The development of copper mining and high altitude pastoralism are important themes for the study of Bronze Age societies in the Alps. The complex network of economic and social relationships within and beyond the Alps established during the Bronze Age were a preface to the emergence of the famous Iron Age cultures; Hallstatt and La Tene. We will then consider how Roman control of the Alps manifests itself in the archaeological and palaeoenvironmental record; this will, however, be prefaced by a review of the evidence for Hannibal’s infamous traverse of the alpine massif. The final lecture will consider how alpine economies developed during the medieval period, how new social systems influenced the development of key and industrial activities - from cheese production to tourism.
This module will adopt a holistic approach, considering the way interdisciplinary research allows us to develop an image of how people adapted to these often harsh environments.

In this module, you can explore these different ways of preserving the dead, learning the different methodologies employed in Ancient Egypt and South America. You will also explore how scientific techniques can be used by archaeologists to reveal the past worlds of mummies in incredible detail. In past years, students have said they really enjoyed the in-depth discussions of Egyptian mummification and also enjoyed the exploration of other cultures that they had never thought of.

Yet mummies were manufactured on four continents, ie. South America, Africa, Asia, Australia and Europe, in addition to those bodies preserved naturally in the varied environments of desert, ice or bog.

This module will survey the development of the Neolithic and Bronze Age societies across a wide geographic region spanning North Africa and the Near East. A zone that provides the backdrop for the rise of a number of major late prehistoric ‘civilisations’ including those of Egypt and Mesopotamia. The course will offer regional comparison and consider the cross cultural connectivity in the prehistoric world, as Bronze Age societies begin to emerge from the Neolithic. We will look at key sites across the region from Çatalhöyük, to Jericho, to Ur, and study the formation of the ancient ‘civilisations’ of the Nile Valley in Egypt and Mesopotamia, considering how this area earned its place as a ‘cradle of civilization’.
Within this context it is possible to explore many of the current evidence and debates concerning the processes of change in complex societies including: social organisation and religion, the environment, the emergence of agrarian economies and villages, technological advancement, literacy and increasing urbanisation, culminating in the emergence of cities, of the state and of class societies. Recently the way in which we understand these processes has begun to change in the light of new archaeological evidence and applied scientific methods.

We will start by considering the role of violence and conflict in shaping human societies evaluating contrasting arguments over whether violence is an innate part of being human, or whether it is a pathology related to the emergence of coercive authorities. Each week will focus on a different period, from the Palaeolithic to the Cold War, examining a range of issues including the role of violence in human evolution, the extent of warfare in prehistory, the challenges for archaeologists in recognising and documenting past conflicts, the and the ritualisation of violence through phenomena such as headhunting and human sacrifice.

 ",,"Think mummification was limited to Ancient Egypt? Think again. Artificial and natural ways of preserving human bodies have been used throughout the past and around the world. To do so, past communities drew on both a deep knowledge of human biology, and natural environments such as deserts, bogs and ice. In this module, you can explore these different ways of preserving the dead, learning the different methodologies employed in Ancient Egypt and South America. You will also explore how scientific techniques can be used by archaeologists to reveal the past worlds of mummies in incredible detail. In past years, students have said “I really enjoyed the in-depth discussions of Egyptian mummification but I also enjoyed the exploration of other cultures that I had never even thought of.”
With the term ‘mummification’ generally applied to human remains which retain their soft tissue (ie. skin, hair, nails), mummified bodies are almost always associated with ancient Egypt. Yet mummies were manufactured on four continents, ie. South America, Africa, Asia, Australia and Europe, in addition to those bodies preserved naturally in the varied environments of desert, ice or bog. Each lecture of this module therefore features examples of the main types of mummified remains, drawing on some of the work carried out by departmental staff and by the university’s Mummy Research Group, both in the field and in the museum environment. Also an overview of the main forms of scientific investigation is provided. The module is concluded with a case study of modern mummification utilising ancient Egyptian methods of preservation.

Spanning the later Neolithic and Early Bronze Age (c.9500-2000 BC), the course will offer regional comparison and consider the cross cultural connectivity in the prehistoric world, as Bronze Age societies begin to emerge from the Neolithic of the region.
Students have enjoyed getting to grips with the archaeology of a hugely important geographic region, which is not touched upon in depth in other parts of the Undergraduate programs. 
This module will survey the development of the Neolithic and Bronze Age societies across a wide geographic region spanning North Africa and the Near East. A zone that provides the backdrop for the rise of a number of major late prehistoric ‘civilisations’ including those of Egypt and Mesopotamia. The course will offer regional comparison and consider the cross cultural connectivity in the prehistoric world, as Bronze Age societies begin to emerge from the Neolithic. We will look at key sites across the region from Çatalhöyük, to Jericho, to Ur, and study the formation of the ancient ‘civilisations’ of the Nile Valley in Egypt and Mesopotamia, considering how this area earned its place as a ‘cradle of civilization’.
Within this context it is possible to explore many of the current evidence and debates concerning the processes of change in complex societies including: social organisation and religion, the environment, the emergence of agrarian economies and villages, technological advancement, literacy and increasing urbanisation, culminating in the emergence of cities, of the state and of class societies. Recently the way in which we understand these processes has begun to change in the light of new archaeological evidence and applied scientific methods. We will explore the history of archaeology in the region and critical perspectives of current syntheses of prehistoric societies based upon comparative analysis of a variety of case studies and evidence, both within this geographic arena, and across a wider global context. Each lecture of this module will introduce key case studies to explore the various themes and issues related to understanding the subtle complexities and processes of change in these Late Prehistoric societies.

",,"In 1711, Joseph Addison declared, in Spectator no. 69, that the ‘single Dress of a Woman of Quality is often the Product of an hundred Climates’. This module examines the cultural and literary contexts of fashion and material culture within a global eighteenth century. The eighteenth century was a period of considerable growth for Britain’s textile industries, fashion culture, and its global trade in commodities—and each of these areas was inextricably linked to the nation’s involvement in saltwater slavery and
colonialism. From the tea table’s sugar and tea leaves to the cotton on mechanized looms in Manchester and mahogany furniture in drawing and dining rooms, fashion and material culture were made from and shaped by ‘an hundred Climates’. We’ll keep this global picture in mind, and the sources of wealth that fueled the purchasing power of Britons, as we consider the products that made up the dress of the ‘Woman of Quality’ but also the appearance and possessions of those on the margins of, and those far from, the ‘quality’.
In addition to negotiating relations and identities between home and abroad, fashion and material culture operated as vehicles through which to contemplate, worry about and even resist major concerns about the self and others. Then as now, fashion and the material world were vital aspects of culture and central to perceptions of national identity, gender, class and social mobility. Eighteenth-century fashion and material culture were also undeniably modern, subject to changing trends and perceived as holding the ability to transform their subjects. Across the period and across genres, fashion and material objects, particularly imported goods, drew the interest and ire of cultural commentators and moralists, as well as attracted the imagination of artists and authors. We’ll examine the crosscurrents between print culture and fashion, between the page and material culture, in order to trace the ways in which fashion and material culture constituted central nodes of how eighteenth-century Britons engaged with the world and with each other.",,https://www.york.ac.uk/,https://www.york.ac.uk/students/studying/manage/programmes/module-catalogue/module/CES00015M/2021-22,

",,"Founded as a speculative corporation of London merchants, in the seventeenth century the East India Company was overshadowed by its Dutch competitor and by powerful Asian empires. By the 1760s, however, the Company had acquired an empire in Bengal and was a major influence in British society and culture. This module explores this transformation. It reflects an explosion of interest in the Company over the past decade.

Through close reading of literary texts, as well as studying the historical context, students will develop their critical skills in documenting the significance of this new breed of independent, educated women. Students will grasp how, as a character in the novel, the New Woman had far-reaching political and ethical implications: her thoughts and desires highlighted not only her own aspirations, but also reflected the entrenched attitudes of society. The course will cover Sarah Grand’s book The Heavenly Twins, in which the central character refuses to consummate her marriage when she discovers her husband’s dubious sexual past. We will also examine Thomas Hardy’s Jude the Obscure, in which Sue Brideshead bears Jude’s children but refuses to marry him, as well as Gissing’s The Odd Women, and the contrasting opportunities and pitfalls presented to women by the pursuit of marriage on the one hand and the pursuit of education, employment and independence on the other. Through class discussion, short oral presentations and assessed written work, students will gain critical confidence and a deeper understanding of how literature pioneers and reflects ethical issues in society.",,,"Upon successful completion of the module, students will be able to:

•             Understand the political, cultural and historical significance of the ‘New Woman’ in the late Victorian period and how the phenomenon was portrayed in the literature of the day
•             Critically respond to the literary texts under examination – their formal qualities as well as their content – and identify the connections between the authors/characters and the wider historical, and political context
•             Appreciate the significance of literature to both pioneer new ways of thinking about sexual politics, as well as reflect the social and historical context of its production
•             Articulate connections between early developments in feminist fiction and later incarnations, illustrating how novels play a crucial role in our understanding of the human condition
 
Development of academic and graduate skills and qualities:
•             Utilise both close textual analysis and critically contextualised readings to produce more sophisticated levels of interpretation and sustained argument
•             Develop oral communication, research, and essay writing skills through class discussion, assessed written work and feedback

This module aims to help students understand factors and issues in transcultural communication and how this differs from 'intercultural communication': students will be expected to critically analyse sterotyped or essentialist views of culture, whether national, religious or otherwise socio-historically constructed, and move towards an understanding of communication in a constantly fluctuating context where cultural identities are emergent. It is hoped and expected that participation in this module will bring about cultural and identity shifts, as well as changes in perceptions of culture and language.

University of York,UOY,Centre for Medieval Studies,Art & Imagery in York Minster - MST00024M,20,,"York Minster is the largest Gothic cathedral in northern Europe. It preserves the most extensive collection ofmedieval stained glass in Britain, dating from the late twelfth to the early sixteenth century. Its architectural sculpture is of great variety and importance. In its thirteenth-century chapter house it boasts one of Europes most remarkable feats of structural engineering, designed to showcase a decorative display of exceptional richness manifest in several media. By the end of the Middle Ages its choir housed the largest late-medieval shrine base in England, while an earlier cult site remained a focus for pilgrim interest. Much of this medieval imagery has survived and further light is shed by the antiquarian record, which is exceptionally rich.
This course will examine some of the surviving iconographic schemes in the Minster, looking not just at the stained glass, but also at the remaining medieval sculpture and monumental paintings so as to give as comprehensive a view as possible of the imagery in the Minster. We will start with the earliest standing part of the building, viz the transepts and chapter house. While following a broad chronological outline, so as to situate the works of art within the architectural development of the building, we shall focus on material which exemplifies the great variety of imagery, both theological and religious, and secular and humorous, within the Minster; and we shall be able to draw on literature which ranges from early antiquarian sources up to a number of very recent studies.
The art and imagery of the Minster will also be considered in relation to other contemporary schemes both at home and abroad. Seminars will be conducted both in the building and in the class-room and we will take full advantage of current conservation projects in order to gain privileged access to some of the Minsters most extraordinary treasures.",,,"To familiarise students with past and current trends in scholarship relating to York Minster.

London: Penguin, 2009.",,"The conversion of Europe to Christianity was one of the most significant transformations of the Middle Ages. But it may be understood as part of a broader story: the first millennium CE saw the rise and spread across Eurasia of scriptural faiths with universal claims, and the decline of polytheistic, dynastically specific or locally focused pagan beliefs. Much of the success of Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, and Judaism was down to the development of powerful religious images and distinct visual identities.
This module foregrounds visual and material evidence in the study of first millennium religion, focusing in each session on key images, objects and sites as case studies. The questions we tackle will relate as much to the reception of images as to their creation. Did viewers of the Hinton St Mary mosaic see Christ, or the Roman Emperor? Did Islamic rulers really dispense with all human images? Why did European Christians and Indian Buddhists venerate holy relics? And what use were illuminated holy books to those who could not read?
Alongside our strong focus on visual sources, we shall investigate contemporary responses by reading relevant primary texts such as pilgrimage narratives, doctrinal tracts, histories and hagiographies.
Comparative themes include relics in different traditions, the political and dynastic use of religious images, and iconoclasm. We shall also explore how these religions used the visual in conversation with each other, through connection – such as the transmission of motifs – and distinction – including in their use of figural images or holy text.
The conversion of Europe to Christianity was one of the most significant transformations of the Middle Ages. But it may be understood as part of a broader story: the first millennium CE saw the rise and spread across Eurasia of scriptural faiths with universal claims, and the decline of polytheistic, dynastically specific or locally focused pagan beliefs. Much of the success of Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, and Judaism was down to the development of powerful religious images and distinct visual identities.
This module foregrounds visual and material evidence in the study of first millennium religion, focusing in each session on key images, objects and sites as case studies. The questions we tackle will relate as much to the reception of images as to their creation. Did viewers of the Hinton St Mary mosaic see Christ, or the Roman Emperor? Did Islamic rulers really dispense with all human images? Why did European Christians and Indian Buddhists venerate holy relics? And what use were illuminated holy books to those who could not read?
Alongside our strong focus on visual sources, we shall investigate contemporary responses by reading relevant primary texts such as pilgrimage narratives, doctrinal tracts, histories and hagiographies.

University of York,UOY,Centre for Medieval Studies,Ceramic Arts of the Islamic World: a framework for study - MST00072M,20,,"Ceramics have the advantage over many other categories of material culture in that they were produced in large numbers, break easily, and cannot be recycled in the way precious metals can. By studying the glazed wares produced across the Islamic world in the medieval and early modern period a broad understanding of the trade, techniques and regional styles emerges. Through the prism of one medium, works in others can be better understood, such as glass, metal, wood and stone. In addition, the early phase in the development in Persian painting survives primarily in the ceramic arts, rather than on paper.
There are large holdings of both complete wares and shards in many collections, allowing students the opportunity for direct engagement with the objects being studied.
This course takes an interdisciplinary approach, introducing students to archaeology, petrography, spectroscopy and repair technologies, as well as traditional art historical approaches to the material.
The study of the ceramic arts of the Islamic world provides a clear and coherent method of understanding the visual aesthetics of a wide array of different dynasties from across the wider region.
In the final portion of the course, students will examine the role of faking and restoration in the commercial market for Islamic ceramics from the late nineteenth century onwards, and see how this has affected the curation and display of wares in museums as well as why some classes of wares are more widely published than others.",,,"By completing this course students will be able to identify the origin and production methods of a wide range of wares produced across the Islamic world from the seventh to the nineteenth centuries.
Alongside studying a wide array of table wares, students will develop an understanding of a significant number of different architectural uses of ceramics.
By studying the wide-ranging diffusion of ceramics from their place of production, and the movement of ingredients, such as tin, cobalt and lapis lazuli, students will gain insights into the international trading networks, by both land and sea, which were in operation throughout the period of study
The object handling and recognition skills developed in this course will prepare students for further research, as well as working with ceramics and other classes of Islamic art in museums, galleries and auction houses.
Students will gain an understanding of the interactions between the competing commercial, academic and curatorial interests in the wider international art market","

We will also read excerpts from a range of Arabic scientific and philosophical texts (all read in modern English translation) including Ibn al-Sina (Avicenna) Canon of Medicine, Mash’Allah (Messahallah) On the Construction and Use of an Astrolabe; Ibn al-Tamimi al-Sheikh (Senior) Letter to the Sun and the Moon; Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) Book on Optics.",,"Geoffrey Chaucer’s expansive literary imaginative can take a reader from Persian Babylonia to Muslim Syria and Mongol Sarai, and across crusading arenas that stretch from the Baltic to North Africa and Southern Spain via England, France, Italy. In addition to such places, we also encounter Persian polymaths, Arab philosophers and North African translators, all of whom became the standard bearers of knowledge in Latin Christendom and whose writings, which developed within and across Islamic world(s), had a profound influence on western medieval learning and culture, including Chaucer’s poetry and prose. This module will introduce students to the multiple and variegated connections between late medieval England and the medieval Islamic world(s) with a focus on Arabic learning and Chaucer’s literature. It will explore how, and in what ways, medieval English literature used, adapted and transformed scientific and philosophical ideas translated and developed in the Islamic world(s).
Each week, we will explore a different facet of Arabic scientific and philosophical learning (medicine, astronomy/astrology, natural philosophy, alchemy, mathematics and optics) paired with a text by Chaucer. In putting medieval scientific and philosophical texts by Arabic and Latin scholars (read in English translation) in dialogue with Middle English poetry, we will endeavour to ask how did writers from different geographical, religious and cultural perspectives conceive the physical body and mind?  How did they represent disease and cures? In what ways was this influenced by conceptions of the natural world and the cosmos? How, where, and why does Chaucer use such ‘Arabic science’ in his poetry and how might it influence his depiction of love, loss and the cosmos? We will also turn to theoretical considerations of the representation of Islam, the ‘East’ and medieval orientalism. While focused on Chaucer, in some seminars we will extend discussion to Arabic literature, including the 1001 Nights; other canonical poets interested and influenced by the ‘East’ including Boccaccio and Dante, and poets writing in the age of Chaucer, such as John Gower and William Langland.  
The module aims to place a western, canonical poet in dialogue with non-western writings, ideas and concepts. In doing so, the primary material will include texts originally written in Arabic (read in modern English translation) by figures who are Arab, Persian, North African, Muslim, Christian and Jewish.",,https://www.york.ac.uk/,https://www.york.ac.uk/students/studying/manage/programmes/module-catalogue/module/MST00075M/2021-22,

 ",,"In an Icelandic saga, a family are burned to death in their home. In Norway, a medieval queen is laid to rest in a
custom-built ship, driven into a massive earth mound. In Dorset, 54 medieval Scandinavian skeletons are found
decapitated. It is often through the record of death that we are able to learn about the life and worldview of the
Vikings. All human societies remember, commemorate and even celebrate their dead; but across the Viking
diaspora, there was no one way to deal with the dead. The Viking dead might feast in Valhalla, or be prisoners of Hell, or await resurrection at the Last Judgement. They might be buried or cremated; put in ship burials or funerary mounds or forgotten patches of land and sea; marked with hogbacks or standing stones or not at all. Some commemorations were entirely pagan; others drew on the new Christian religion.
This module seeks to understand the traces left in the varied death records of the Viking age in different parts of the diaspora. It takes an interdisciplinary approach to the Viking age dead, how they were commemorated and how memories were preserved. Alongside the archaeology of funerary practices, there is a wealth of information in sagas, poetry, laws, and runic inscriptions, revealing how death was understood in the Viking world. This module drives towards an understanding of the role of remembrance in funerary practices and the importance – to the Vikings and to us – of preserving the memories of the dead.

University of York,UOY,Centre for Medieval Studies,"England, Europe, Elsewhere: The Art & Architecture of Medieval England & its International Context - MST00080M",20,,"In October and November of 1955, German émigré art historian Nikolaus Pevsner delivered the Reith Lectures, a series of radio lectures disseminated over the BBC’s airwaves. Pevsner, at the time of his lectures, had spent two decades in the country; his series was titled The Englishness of English Art. In the foreword to the book based on his lectures, Pevsner queries the project, writing ‘why should I have set myself up as a judge of English qualities in English art, being neither English-born nor English bred’?
Throughout this module, we will consider whether it is possible to assess national character in art and architecture, and whether doing so matters. Some questions we will consider are: what was English about art and architecture in medieval England? Do the makers of English medieval art identify as English, in opposition with their counterparts in Europe and elsewhere? How has English art history constructed its view of the Middle Ages? How do contemporary issues of nationalism temper and distort our ability to historicize the Middle Ages? What is globalism, and are the Middle Ages ‘global’? In this course, we will consider these questions through an examination of English medieval art and architecture and its points of unity, disjunction, and intersection with the wider world.
This module will consider on art and architecture from the pre-Conquest period to the Henry VIII’s split with Rome and the Reformation in England, with a focus on understanding that which is “English” and the way art and architecture relate to and communicate Europe and the broader world. This will entail an examination of style, labour, materials, as well as patrons, institutions, and networks. Furthermore, we will consider the way medieval art has been studied and exhibited in the UK and beyond.
This module will be organized in case studies, some of which are described here. We will begin with a consideration of the Anglo-Scandinavian period and the impact of the Vikings on England, focusing on York, as well as tracing the linkages with England and Scandinavia for the duration of the Middle Ages. England’s relationship with Normandy and the rupture caused by the Norman Conquest in 1066 will be the focus on sessions on the Bayeux Embroidery and Durham Cathedral. In two sessions on the beginning of Gothic architecture in England, we will examine monastic architecture of the Cistercians the architectural principles they brought to Yorkshire, and the cult of Saint Thomas Becket and the emergence of French Gothic at Canterbury in the 1170s (and likewise the cult of Becket disseminated to Scandinavia and the Continent). England’s artistic exports, namely Opus Anglicanum (fine needlework) and alabaster sculpture will be considered both stylistically and economically. Looking at ivory sculptures, we will map the arrival of ivory from Africa into Europe with a consideration of trade and focus on English patronage of ivories. Continuing our focus on trade, we will examine the trading world of the late Middle Ages, focusing on England’s role in the European wool trade, which was influential in the rebuilding of parish churches at the hand of merchants.
This module will be comprised of lectures and discussions organised around a series of case studies. Students will gain an understanding of relevant primary sources and contemporary scholarship. They will also be aware of the historiography and the range of methodologies available for studying this material. By the end of this course, students will have a fluency with English art and architectural production of the Middle Ages that exists within an international context.",,,"By the end of the module, students should have acquired:
knowledge of a corpus of significant buildings and artworks produced in the British Isles during the Middle Ages
an understanding of how art and architecture produced in the British Isles during the Middle Ages fits into a broader European and global context
an understanding of the role of nationalism in the study of the Middle Ages, and how such thinking has inflected the field to date
the ability to reflect critically on various scholarly approaches and familiarity with some of the methodologies available to scholars of medieval art history

It will draw on a range of disciplinary and methodological approaches in both textual and material culture in order to examine issues such as power, authority, legitimacy and learning across various geographies belonging to a so-called singular ‘Islamic World’.
Text as Image/Image as Text
This section starts by looking at narrative images. The section will look at how material culture can bridge the gap between words and images in the medieval Islamic world. This first part will examine how an image can tell a different story, or tell the same story in a different way, when it is divorced from the text. There is an examination of the use and role of literature and poetics in Islamic societies. This section will also include a detailed study of the use of decorative text on buildings that can be placed in the interstices between word and ornament. The spread of the Arabic language and its use in monumental public contexts allows for a clearer understanding of the ways in which religious authority was projected from the early to the late medieval period.
Power Projection and Legitimacy
The second theme builds on the previous one, and concerns the ways in which power and legitimacy were presented in the public sphere. The public text, and the use of different methods of power projection and legitimization are examined through the prism of objects at the extreme ends of scale and mobility. The concepts of legitimacy, trade, the economy, and the diffusion of ideas concerning caliphal power and authority will also be explored. Subjects including the writing of history and the historiography of political thought will give a wider context to the cases studies and embed them into the broader historical continuum.
Science and Learning
This section builds on the previous two by turning to the intellectual, scientific and philosophical developments that occurred across places such as Abbasid Baghdad, Fatimid Cairo, Samanid Bukhara, and Buyid Iran. Here, we will explore how the so-called ‘Golden Age of Islam’ occurred across multiple regions and courts. In Baghdad, we will examine the role of the so-called Bayt al-Hikma (‘House of Wisdom’) and the Graeco-Arabic translation movement; in Fatimid Cairo, we will consider the al-Azhar as a place of learning and delve into the importance of the Cairo Geniza; and we will turn to Samanid Bukhara as a place that was formative for the polymath Ibn al-Sina, but which rivalled Baghdad as a place of scholarship and aimed to revive Persian as a language of literacy and scholarship. We will explore these places through a combination of material culture, literary, historical and scientific texts.

 ",,"Throughout the Middle Ages, writers from St Augustine to Christine de Pizan recounted the lives of others and themselves in diverse ways. By the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, there were longstanding traditions of life-writing about religious people and saints, philosophers and princes, not just in the form of chronological narratives, but also in other genres and forms such as debates, dialogues, visions and letters. This module will explore the ways in which late medieval French and English writers built upon these traditions to tell the stories of contemporary figures, from religious men and women to kings and aristocrats. These case-studies will open up windows into the diverse experiences of people across late medieval society, and also reveal important developments in writing and thinking about the past: many late medieval writers espoused standards of evidence that seem distinctly modern, drawing on reliable written sources, interviewing eyewitnesses, and cross-checking their facts wherever possible; others freely embellished and invented not only events and dialogue but the sources to support them. The module will also consider the ways in which writers and narrators inserted their own voices into their stories, together with wider developments in autobiographical writing, memoirs and eyewitness accounts by laymen that offer less mediated access to the ideas, values and emotions of different groups within society.
Students will attend eight weekly two-hour seminars in weeks 2-9. The provisional outline for the module is as follows:
1. Medieval Traditions of Life-Writing
2. Royal Panegyrics (i): Saint Louis, king of France (d. 1270)
3. Royal Panegyrics (ii): Henry V (d. 1422) and Henry VI (d. 1471)

Attempts by early modern historians to impose assumptions, such as the absence of a concept of childhood or of romantic love as a factor in the making of marriages, on the period simply do not stand up to scrutiny.

University of York,UOY,Centre for Medieval Studies,"Medieval Islamic Architecture on the Frontiers: Synthesis, Innovation & Change - MST00076M",20,,"Through a close study of a number of sites on the frontiers of the medieval Islamic world, focused on the period spanning the eleventh to the thirteenth centuries, students will gain an insight into some of the most innovative, syncretic and dynamic areas of architectural synthesis. The interaction of established forms with new materials, and the complex cultural milieu, that saw Muslim rulers with Christian wives, and Muslim patrons employing indigenous non-Muslim craftsmen to try and deliver their wishes resulted in a  range of fascinating, unique, yet for the most part very poorly studied, structures across Anatolia, northern India, and Central Asia.
The exchange of forms and motifs between the stone tradition of Armenian architecture and the brick and glazed tile style of Iran can be seen in Anatolia. Innovative use of unglazed terracotta and brick under the Qarakhanids in Central Asia laid the foundations for the grand Timurid monuments of the following centuries. In India, the synthesis of pre-existing Islamic architectural ideas developed in Iran and Central Asia with the lithic and trabeate indigenous Indic forms saw the emergence of perhaps the most distinctive tradition of building, one that eventually led to the apotheosis of the tradition with the Taj Mahal half a millennium later.
By developing skills in the comparison of related, but geographically separate, architectural traditions in the eleventh to the thirteenth centuries, students will gain an understanding of a wide area and the long-distance transmission of forms and motifs, as well as the resulting emergence of local and regional styles and techniques. The material covers a wide range of styles, and draws on a number of different disciplines. In addition, the cited scholarship was created in a variety of different academic environments, from the rigid formalism of the Soviet Union to the nationalist paradigms of states such as Turkey and Uzbekistan, along with more contemporary research produced by scholars in Europe and the USA. Such a diverse array of materials will allow student to learn how to interrogate such different sources critically and effectively.",,,"Subject content

Based primarily around archaeological and historical evidence from urban and rural settlements, landscapes, and buildings from across Britain, this class will discuss the material dimensions of society, community, belief, and identity in the medieval period.
This module seeks to develop an understanding of the inhabitation of medieval England; the places and spaces in which medieval communities lived, worked, played and worshipped. We will be interested not only in the creation, development, and occasional desertion of settlements, but also in the relationships between people and their environment. How did particular landscapes influence the forms of settlements, such as farmsteads, villages and towns? What impact did they have on the ways in which people could earn their living? What kinds of communities resulted? What was the role of religion and belief, at both an institutional and personal level?

University of York,UOY,Centre for Medieval Studies,Punishing the Body - MST00079M,20,,"“Images of medieval punishment are commonly understood with reference to what Umberto Eco has dubbed ‘shaggy medievalism’, the idea of the Middle Ages as a barbaric epoch. In a culture ravaged by violence, death, pain and disease, the story goes, it was entirely natural that [the medieval world] should exhibit a profound fascination with flowing blood, torn flesh, fragmented body parts.” (Mills, 2005, p. 8)
In popular modern cultural perceptions ‘the medieval’ often stands as a proxy for violence and pain visited on the human body. Certain legal penalties did indeed stipulate bodily mutilation as a punishment that literally inscribed the laws of the land onto the physical body in order to dishonour and impair the criminal. Yet a Christian could chastise the body in order to enhance their chance of salvation in the next life. To define what ‘the body’ meant to the medieval world is far from simple, for linked to the notion of the physical body are a myriad of further ideas including metaphorical concepts such as the body politic or the body of the Church. Add gender into the picture and matters become even more complex. Actual female bodies were often viewed as weaker, more impure and more easily tempted into sin than their male counterparts. At the same time, however, the Church itself was frequently viewed (and indeed celebrated) as a female entity in its role as the bride of Christ. From these few examples alone, it becomes clear that ‘the body’ is both a physical and a cultural construct whose meaning changed over time, location and social context.      
This module focuses on one particular aspect of the body: punishment. ‘Punishment’ is also a term that requires further definition, for there are many different forms that it can take and many different meanings to be gleaned from its use; indeed, punishment of the body could be voluntary or involuntary, brief or long lasting, longed for or feared. In a political situation, bodily punishment could be an important element within power mechanisms that guaranteed social order and stability; however, from a religious perspective, divine punishment that purified the mortal body could empower the individual. In this module, we will explore the different ways in which punishment of the human body was part of an ordered human experience in different parts and periods of the medieval world.",,,"After completing this module students should have:
a) An understanding of a range of theoretical approaches to medieval punishment
b) An awareness of the variety of source material available to study the topic and an understanding of some of the problems involved in the use of these sources
c) The ability to use and reflect critically upon a range of relevant interdisciplinary primary and secondary material
d) An understanding of comparative approaches to interdisciplinary questions","J.P. Gates and N. Marafioti (ed.), Capital and Corporal Punishment in Anglo-Saxon England (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 2014)

L. Tracy, Torture and Brutality in Medieval Literature: Negotiations of National Identity (Boydell & Brewer Ltd, 2015)",,"From the barbarism in faux-medieval ‘The Game of Thrones’ to media descriptions of ISIS violence as ‘medieval’, popular modern culture often associates the idea of bodily punishment, blood and gore with the medieval period. However, ‘the body’ is both a corporeal form and a cultural construct whose meaning changed over time, location and social context. Punishment visited on the body was therefore both personal and political, individual as well as social. This module will use a range of theoretical approaches and interdisciplinary sources to unpick the various strands of meaning encoded in the image of the punished body throughout the medieval period in both its physical and metaphorical forms.

University of York,UOY,Centre for Medieval Studies,Reading Dante's Comedy: Text & Context - MST00051M,20,,"I expect your father has been reading Dante: thus, the memorable reply from Cecil Vyse in E. M. Forsters A Room with a View, upon hearing George Emerson repeat his fathers assertion that there is only one perfect view - the view of the sky straight over our heads, and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of it. Cecil Vyse assumes that a knowledge of Dante is simply part of the cultural baggage of any literate gentleman. Very few authors from the medieval period have so pervasively influenced writing in so many European languages across successive centuries right down to the present day. Arguably, a knowledge of the work of Dante remains a vital part of the cultural baggage of any literate, critical reader. Medievalists find in the poem a philosophical, theological, political and literary synthesis of much that is crucial in their period, but Renaissance scholars, Romanticists, Victorianists and modernists all find many concerns of their respective periods worked out in response to the poem.
The Comedy can, however, be a daunting poem, and risks being cited more often than it is read. This module will introduce readers to this masterpiece of European literature. The poem will be read in English translation, assuming no prior knowledge of Italian.
The aim of the module is to introduce students to Dante's Comedy, setting the poem in its cultural and literary context; students will be introduced to the poem s structure and moral architecture, and the module will proceed with close readings of some of its most famous canti, such as (amongst others) Inf. 5 (Paolo and Francesca), Inf. 10 (Farinata and Cavalcanti), Inf. 26 (Ulysses), and Par. 11 (St Francis of Assisi).
Module aims include:
To give students the opportunity to develop a sound understanding of Dante's Comedy
To give students a knowledge of major trends in modern Dante scholarship
To enable students to develop their skills in close-reading",,,"Students will be able to;
undertake a research-led essay project addressing the aims of the module
undertake with confidence a close-reading of relevant parts of the Comedy
speak and write with confidence on a variety of aspects of Dante, his context and his great poem.
Academic and graduate skills
Students will demonstrate advanced skills of writing appropriate to a postgraduate degree
Gain a set of skills which will complement the core-courses for a variety of MA programmes offered by the Department of English and Related Literature","There are several single-volume translations, but particularly useful is that of Allen Mandelbaum (Everyman, 1995). Parallel translations will prove particularly useful, enabling comparisons with the Italian as well as keeping an eye on rhyme words, line endings, and the appearance of key words; the best is the translation and facing-text prepared by Robert M. Durling and Ronald M. Martinez, 3 vols (OUP, 1996-2011), which has superb notes; there is also the excellent facing translation of Robin Kirkpatrick, 3 vols (Penguin, 2006-2007).

Frequent reference will be made to Virgil s Aeneid, Ovid's Metamorphoses, and the Bible. Readers will find useful having a translation to hand of Dante's early work, La Vita nuova (The New Life), available in many translations (those of Barbara Reynolds and Mark Musa for example).

Saints’ cults were central to much of medieval social, religious, and political life. The memories and physical remains of holy men and women were venerated throughout Europe, and their ranks were ever-growing as each successive generation made or ‘found’ role models and miracle makers. The vast number of hagiographies and other sources for the practice and management of the cult of saints attest to the importance of holy bodies in creating social and corporate identity, exercising power, and serving the spiritual needs of medieval Europe. The twelfth and thirteenth centuries in particular saw, on the one hand, an emerging ‘papal monarchy’ seeking to regulate and rule Western Christianity, and on the other a great flowering of religious energy revitalising old cults and producing a wealth of new recognised and ‘popular’ saints. This module explores how, at a time of great economic and social change, saints' cults were brought into being, written, approved, promoted, and used, and how they were responsive to the shifting concerns of the age. Why did some saints flourish and others disappear without trace? With a strong focus on primary material including individual hagiographies, ecclesiastical records, and the physical remains of cults, a series of case studies will be set in the context of papal, political, and social reforms, encouraging a broader understanding of the central place of the saints in this formative period of European history.  Teaching Programme: Students will attend eight weekly two-hour seminars in weeks 2-9.

On the shoulders of the pioneering scholars of the twelfth century, later medieval thinkers built a system of study in which reason and enquiry, rather than authority, formed the basis of academic research. In its ascendancy, the scholastic project explored the scope, and reach, of human understanding, but inherent in this approach was a capacity for radical and even heterodox thought that generated debates whose implications resonated far beyond the confines of the universities.
This module looks at the impact of this changing attitude to the role of rational intellect and human knowledge. Our focus will be on the Universities of Paris, Bologna, and Oxford, but we will also look at Prague and other northern universities. Through the treatises, polemics, and letters that make up the substance of the intellectual world of the period, we will examine the major debates and controversies that lie at heart of shifts in the cultural and religious climate of the later Middle Ages. We will look at the ways in which discussions about how the world should be understood and ordered led inevitably to discussions about the source of spiritual, and by implication secular, authority. The role of scepticism and heterodoxy in the formation of orthodoxy will be considered, as well as the relationship of universities to dissent, a recurring theme in contemporary discourse as well as in modern historiography

This course offers an advanced introduction to the challenges of finding, editing, and interpreting Middle English writings from a pre-print culture, with practical instruction in the skills required by editors and literary critics of medieval texts. While some seminars will focus on issues relating to textual criticism, the majority will consider different aspects of codicological study (materials, script, illumination, binding, attribution, provenance, etc.), providing insight into the research methods employed by specialists.
There will be an opportunity for first-hand examination of medieval books where the focus will be on writing a formal description of a manuscript (or a ‘copy-specific’ record of an early printed book).

",,"In Viking Age Scandinavia, poetry was embedded in social practice and public performance. Composed in the Old Norse language, a great quantity of Viking poetry – originally oral, but later written down in manuscripts – survives to the present day, and it is an amazing body of work, full of interest and surprises.
Some Old Norse poetry – usually called ‘Eddic’ by modern scholars – was anonymous, and told mythological stories of the Norse gods and legendary heroes. But much more of the poetry that survives – now called ‘skaldic’ – is attributable to named poets, and was composed on specific, datable occasions; as early medieval poetry, the potential for reconstructing its literary history is unusually high. Skaldic poetry had many purposes: it was used to glorify rulers (‘King, another lord loftier than you will never be born’); to commemorate friends (‘I have piled a mound of praise that long will stand without crumbling in poetry’s field’); to insult enemies (‘Bjorn the windbag remains a useless loser’); and even to woo sexual partners (‘I looked at the ankles of the finely grown woman – this yearning will not die from me all my life’).
This module will examine a wide range of poetry, both Eddic and skaldic, composed in Old Norse between about 850 and 1050, and due attention will also be paid to its later preservation in Icelandic sagas and poetic treatises. Each seminar will address a different theme or topic, and will be structured around the close and detailed engagement with two or three particular poems (copies of which will be supplied).

In discussing these theories we will challenge heterosexualitys normative status, building on feminist critiques of heterosexuality. This will provide grounding for critical engagement with some of the major controversies which have been generated around sexuality - both amongst feminists and in broader arenas of public debate. The specific issues covered will depend on the interests of students and might include, for example: pornography and representations of the erotic; commercial sex; power and pleasure; sexual violence; families and sexuality; childhood and sexuality; sexuality education; sexology and sex manuals; the medicalization of sexual problems; the sexualisation of culture debates; the construction of sexual identities; romantic love, monogamy and couple relationships.",,,"After successfully completing this course students should:  Have a good grasp of the idea of the social construction of sexuality, why it has been important to feminist analysis and the variety of forms social constructionism can take Have become familiar with the works of key theorists within the field of sexuality Understand the history and basis of the major sources of contestation and debate within the study of sexuality Be able to apply theoretical perspectives to empirical work on sexuality and evaluate theory in the light of empirical research","Hockey, J., Meah, A. and Robinson, V.

It starts by critically engaging with mainstream western feminist historiography, problematizing the concept of ‘feminism’, including its application in diverse cultural and historical contexts, as well as the ideas of ‘waves’ and ‘generations’ of feminism. With that critique in mind, it then proceeds chronologically, homing in on a diverse range of historical moments and texts in the long twentieth century, focusing in on for example: debates around women’s suffrage, feminism, class and sexuality in the early twentieth century; Simone de Beauvoir’s pioneering The Second Sex (1949); radical ideas and feminist militancy during the so-called ‘second wave’; Judith Butler, queer theory and activism; intersectionality and issues of diversity; and the recent #MeToo movement.

In the Autumn term, students complete the MChem Advanced Practicals, a selection of single-day laboratory and computational exercises which aim to give students hands-on experience in using advanced techniques, such as the use of Schlenk lines for handling air-sensitive compounds. The Scientific Writing course runs parallel with the MChem Advanced Practicals, and aims to introduce and develop higher-level scientific writing skills, commensurate with writing project reports and scientific literature.
In Spring term, students complete the MChem Group Miniprojects. A range of miniprojects are available, covering different research disciplines within the Department. As a small group, students engage with a research-type task, with support from a miniproject supervisor. The miniprojects are substantially less structured than standard “core” practical work, mimicking the unpredictability of real research. The students collect data as a group, then write reports individually, for submission early in the Summer term (9 credits) and complete a group poster (1 credit). Alongside the Spring term Miniprojects, the students also complete the Integrated Spectroscopy course. This course is designed to foster students’ problem-solving skills, focusing on complex spectroscopic problems. Relying principally on lecture content from previous years, this course requires students to gather data from different sources, and bridge gaps in their understanding, in order to make progress solving the problems.

Your placement will typically be 12 months in duration with some variation depending on the company. Most students will start their placements over the summer vacation. Each project will have an industrial supervisor, a placement supervisor and an independent panel member (IPM - a second marker).  You will spend all of your time on the placement with the exception of required attendance at formal meetings, which are (i) the pre-placement meeting at York before the placement starts, (ii) the initial meeting at your company site 4 to 8 weeks after starting, (iii) the interim progress meeting and other activities at York in January and (iv) the final assessment meeting, including oral examination and presentation, at York in May. Assessment of the project is based on three main areas. These areas are similar to those used for the MChem (York) research projects. During the year the Open Learning Module and the Literature Review Skills Module are also assessed. 1. Marking guidelines for project assessment (35% of placement mark, 26.25% of total year 4 mark)  These concentrate on your ability to plan and execute a project (as well as your transferable skills, since this forms a large part of the MChem (Industry) scheme). A pro forma sheet will be used for the assessment of the project. Your industrial supervisor’s comments concerning the execution of your project will be used by the York placement supervisor to assess the project. Please note that it is your placement supervisor who will allocate your marks, not your industrial supervisor. The marks for the whole year cohort may be subject to adjustment by a moderation panel appointed by the Year 4 Committee during week 9 of Term 12. 2. Oral presentation and examination (25% of placement mark, 18.75% of total year 4 mark)  This is held in York in week 7 of the summer term. The Assessment Panel will consist of your placement supervisor (who will chair the meeting) and your IPM. You will give a presentation lasting for no longer than 20 minutes on your project work. The presentation content is largely up to you, but it should contain an introduction, a discussion of the approach taken, the presentation of results, conclusions and future work. Following the presentation, a 30-40 minute oral examination will take place where you will be expected to answer questions on your presentation. The questions will examine not only your understanding of the project but also your knowledge of chemical principles across the range of the subject; accordingly, the questions may only be tenuously connected with your project. You are strongly advised to revise the whole of your chemistry course (years 1 to 4) in advance of your oral examination. Guidelines for the marking of the presentation and the oral examination are shown in the MChem(Industry) Handbook. Each member of the assessment panel will make an independent assessment of your performance and marks will be collated by the placement supervisor at the end of the assessment. 3. Project report (40% of placement mark, 30% of total year 4 mark)  Your report should be between 4500 and 6500 words, excluding the literature review, and the experimental section, contents, figures, tables, titles and references. A word count should be included at the front of your report, and projects over the word limit will be penalised at a rate of 5 marks per 500 words up to a maximum penalty of 15 marks.",,https://www.york.ac.uk/,https://www.york.ac.uk/students/studying/manage/programmes/module-catalogue/module/CHE00013M/2021-22,

University of York,UOY,Chemistry,Atmospheric Chemistry - CHE00031H,20,,"Human activities lead to the polluting of the atmosphere influencing the quality of the air we breathe, changing the climate and disturbing ecosystems. For example, particulate matter accounts for an average loss of life expectancy of around eight months for every resident of the UK and its economic cost of premature mortality and health service costs amounts to some £16.4 billion per annum. This course is designed to look at the chemical and physical processes important in controlling the concentration of pollutants in the atmosphere both in the gas and aerosol phase and their impact. The course starts with the physics of the atmosphere that determines the movement of air around the planet giving the weather patterns we see every day. It then moves to understand the processes which determine the atmosphere’s temperature and so the climate and how this may have changed in the past and may change into the future. The chemistry important in the urban, background and upper atmosphere is discussed both for gas and aerosol phases. Computer models play a central role in our understanding of atmospheric pollution and a range of these models are discussed.  The different analytical techniques used to measure the composition of the air on the ground, from aircraft and from space are then presented. Finally, three case studies of how this science has been used to determine policy will be presented covering urban air pollution, stratospheric ozone loss and climate change.
At the end of the course students will understand the complexity of the chemistry and physics that determine the composition of the atmosphere, appreciate the tools available to the atmospheric chemist for understanding the composition of the atmosphere and have a sense of how this science has been used to craft government policy to reduce the impact of human activity on the atmosphere.",,,"Met and Physical Climate

Module content:
An Introduction to Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry (DKS, 8 lectures, 1x1.5h workshop)
Initially this set of lectures will give an overview of the historical development of medicinal chemistry and chemotherapy. Focus will then be on the way in which a pharmaceutical interacts with the human body - the problems this can cause, and the opportunities it can provide for more efficient therapy via targeted drug delivery.
Introduction to the Molecular Basis of Diseases (AMB, 6 lectures)
This set of lectures will focus on an explanation of some key molecular aspects of human physiology. It will introduce general classification of diseases (bacterial/viral infections, genetic/complex diseases). This course is a concise survey of the main types of genetic diseases, fundamentals of immune responses, and infections, building the basic biomedical background towards complex disases, giving finally some background to cancer.
Cancer Chemotherapy (MAF, 5 lectures, 1x1.5h workshop)
An exploration of current (and potential) cancer therapeutics. This will include well-established drugs that act on DNA (DNA alkylating agents, cross linkers, intercalating agents), drugs that act on structural proteins (taxol, epothiolones). It will be followed by survey of modern approaches in development of new cancer drug targets in the context of expanding hallmarks of cancer. Molecular challenges in a successful cancer eradication will be discussed.
Modern Approaches to Drug Discovery (REH, 6 lectures, 1x3 h assessed workshop)
This module will provide an understanding of the contribution chemical methods and thinking make to the drug discovery process, including target identification, hit identification and lead optimisation. The target-oriented approach to therapeutic intervention will be illustrated with examples from the molecular and cell biology (influenza, HIV, diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer’s and cancer). The examples will also show how a broad range of chemical, biological, structural and computational techniques are being applied in drug discovery. A recurring theme is the need for an understanding of the required properties for a drug molecule.  This includes an appreciation of the biological processes that determine ADME and toxicity properties and the types of assays that are used to monitor these.
Metals in Medicine (AKDK, 6 lectures, 1x1.5h workshop)
This part of the module provides an introduction to Medicinal Inorganic Chemistry, an emerging new area of chemistry. The field has been stimulated by the success of cisplatin, still one of the best-selling anti-cancer drugs. Topics include recent developments relating to platinum anticancer agents and other established metallodrugs, such as gold-containing anti-arthritic drugs. In addition, clinically useful ion chelators for the treatment of heavy metal poisoning, iron overload and neuro-degenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease, will be discussed. The focus of the final part of the course will be radiodiagnostic and radiotherapeutic isotopes and the development of MRI contrast agents.
Molecular Aspects of Complex Diseases (AMB, 5 lectures, 1x3h workshop)
The first part will cover: the interlink of the classical hormone:membrane receptor (insulin and Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF)) signalling, the impact of common switches in signalling pathways for treatment of diabetes, carcinogenesis of insulin, insulin alternatives to anti-diabetic drug targets (nuclear receptors (anti-obesity), metmorfin (oral anti-diabetics)), importance of insulin/IGF in cancer development. Secondly, the in-health/disease role of an alternative regulation of cell-cell communication (hormone=transcription factor), and its clinical modification will be discussed on examples of nuclear receptors (NR).  Impact of protein aggregation in disease (Alzheimer, Huntington’s) will be presented.

Organic and inorganic molecules preserved in the rock and fossil record can inform our understanding of the nature of living communities that existed in the past and the prevailing environmental conditions both on geological and archaeological timescales. Changes over time in the distributions of such molecular fossils reflect environmental changes, which often relate to climatic influences. This module introduces the underlying concepts and analytical techniques that allow the structures and stable isotopic compositions of fossil and sedimentary organic residues to be exploited. Case studies reveal how records of changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, sea surface and mean air temperatures and relative sea-level can be revealed over geological timescales.

University of York,UOY,Chemistry,Genes to Proteins - CHE00021I,20,,"This module builds on core biological chemistry material taught in Year 2 of the chemistry degree. The first half of the course (for Chemists only) provides a detailed overview of molecular biology – a field which over the last 50 years has transformed biological chemistry. After a brief introduction to genes and genomes, the factors regulating gene expression in bacteria and higher organisms will be explored. The course will consider how genes are translated into proteins and how DNA is replicated with high fidelity. With this foundation the course will go on to describe how genes can be isolated and precisely manipulated – leading to the field of genetic engineering, which is underpinning our understanding of protein function. Methods for tailoring enzyme properties using random and rational approaches will be described with examples.
The second half of the module (for both Chemists and Biochemists) explores advanced aspects of protein science – including protein structure and function, determination of structure and protein engineering. Our appreciation of almost all aspects of biochemistry and molecular biology has been enhanced by the elucidation of atomic resolution structures that reveal the underlying chemical mechanisms responsible for biological function. In addition, our ability to exploit this understanding through the use of genetic approaches to engineer proteins, is leading to the generation of improved proteins for therapeutic and biotechnology applications. Students studying this module will be equipped to go on to further studies in biochemistry/molecular biology related fields of study, as well as having valuable insight into the growing biotechnology sector of industry.",,,"Students will:
learn in detail about transcription and translation of genetic information and gain confidence in understanding the way in which (i) transcription is regulated and (ii) genetic decisions are made.
be expected to appreciate the roles of the macromolecular machines RNA polymerase, DNA polymerase and the ribosome and understand how the information stored within DNA is disseminated.
explore how knowledge of gene structure and function can be exploited through genetic engineering methods. Students will learn how to design oligonucleotides for PCR, sequencing and mutagenesis.
explore the engineering of proteins using various techniques – including rational amino acid mutagenesis, random mutagenesis and DNA shuffling experiments and computer aided design. Students will be expected to appreciate, rationalise and sometimes predict how modification of proteins can modify their behaviour and properties.
engage with a case study based on applications of genetic engineering technology, in order to demonstrate they have come to grips with the key concepts.
understand the basic principles of how protein structures are determined using the methods of X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy or NMR spectroscopy
appreciate how protein structure relates to protein mechanism and thus to biological function.

This leads into the second half of the module which concerns Protein Architecture and Action including how proteins are assembled and/or modified to carry out their functions.
This module begins by exploring the factors that regulate gene expression in bacteria leading to a consideration of how knowledge of gene control allows us to understand the molecular basis of decision-making by cells. We will then discuss how knowledge of gene control and protein synthesis can be exploited for the expression of foreign (such as human) genes in genetically modified micro-organisms. The module will go on to describe the products of these genes - proteins, the most versatile of all molecules. After a discussion of the main features of protein structure, the course will cover the determination of 3D structure through diffraction, microscopy and NMR methods. After a brief discussion of the patterns that are emerging in protein structure (and how this can be exploited to predict protein structure), the course continues with detailed examples of proteins in action.

University of York,UOY,Chemistry,Lasers in Chemistry - CHE00036M,10,,"Lasers have become powerful tools in modern chemistry, where they find applications in fields as diverse as astrochemistry, atmospheric remote sensing and analytical research, while the arrival of ultrafast (femtosecond) pulsed lasers has enabled the observation of molecular reactions in real time. The course offers three perspectives on the applications of lasers in chemistry: The first presents an overview of modern lasers and their operation and will discuss how lasers have advanced our understanding in areas ranging from the chemistry of hostile environments to the biomedical arena. The second presents the field of modern laser spectroscopy as applied to the gas phase, focusing on optical spectroscopies of molecular clusters and the use of lasers to measure the fundamental intermolecular interactions that underpin chemistry and biology. The third introduces the field of femtochemistry, discussing how ultrafast lasers can be used to follow chemical processes in the gas and condensed phases in real time. This will include an introduction to advanced spectroscopic methods such as multidimensional spectroscopy and ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy.",,,"Students will gain an understanding of different laser types and understand how lasers are used to both generate and detect key intermediates that control chemistry in combustion processes, in the Earth's atmosphere, and beyond.

Students will appreciate the applications of ultrafast lasers in molecular spectroscopy and the role of dynamics in chemical processes.","Laser Chemistry: Spectroscopy, Dynamics and Applications by Telle, Gonzalez Urena and Donovan [Wiley]",,"
This module provides an introduction to the world of lasers and their application to a diverse range of problems in chemistry.  The module will comprise three lecture courses, each comprising 6 lectures, covering the following content:
Part one: 6 lectures (AJK x 3 & TJD x 3): Laser fundamentals and applications. The course provides an introduction to the types of lasers used in modern chemistry. The course will then go on to discuss how lasers have contributed to a wide range of research fields within chemistry, from remote sensing applications in astrochemistry or environmental chemistry to biomedical uses of lasers. This course will be assessed by a 90 minute assessed workshop.
Part two: 6 lectures (CED): Lasers for Intermolecular Interactions. The course covers applications of modern optical spectroscopy to the study of molecular clusters. The course will include discussions of intermolecular interactions, molecular beams, microwave and IR spectroscopy of neutral clusters and electronic, photoelectron and threshold photoelectron spectroscopy of neutral and charged clusters. The course will be supported by a 90 minute workshop (CED) and will include the opportunity to observe some of the methods described in action in a research laboratory.
Part three: 6 lectures (NTH): Lasers for making and directing molecular movies. This course introduces the concepts and methods of ultrafast spectroscopy that allow chemists to observe and influence reactions in real-time. The discipline of chemistry is based on changes in molecular structure, but observing the transition states that occur during reaction mechanisms requires a ‘camera’ capable of ‘seeing’ species that exist for just a few femtoseconds (10-15 s). Similarly, many important processes carried out by biological molecules are regulated by the fast dynamics of hydrogen bonds between water molecules, which exchange on picosecond (10-12 s) timescales. The course will describe the development of ultrafast spectroscopy applications in the gas and solution phases in detail before introducing state-of-the-art reaction-following experimental methods that have opened up new horizons for chemistry research. The course will be supported by a 90 minute workshop (NTH) and will include the opportunity to observe some of the methods described in action in a research laboratory.

The material is written up as a literature review in an area related to the student's research project
The review should ideally be between 2500 and 3000 words long, as in this many words you should be able to say what you need to clearly. This limit does not include references, tables, tables of contents or legends to tables or figures and within sensible limits of clarity and good layout, there is no limit to the number of figures or tables you can include. However, figure and table captions should not be used to introduce extra ideas not discussed in the text or as a way of adding extra text. The upper limit is an absolute 3000 words and the penalties for exceeding this length are set out above. Conversely, while there is no explicit penalty for writing fewer than 2500 words, we also believe that it is unlikely that you will be able to cover the breadth of material necessary in so few words. The referencing should reflect the extensive reading you have done in preparing the review and references should be presented correctly and consistently in the accepted style of one of the major journal houses (e.g. Royal Society of Chemistry, American Chemical Society). The review should end with a critical conclusion. This is not the same as a simple summary, rather it should gather together the most important parts of the review and should make critical comments. The conclusion should, therefore, show evidence of your imprint and your contribution to the discussion of the area of literature that you have reviewed.",,https://www.york.ac.uk/,https://www.york.ac.uk/students/studying/manage/programmes/module-catalogue/module/CHE00011M/2021-22,

Students will be allocated/have the opportunity to develop an interdisciplinary MSci project in an industrial setting taking their subject specialism and preferences into account. Projects will involve working in a research group in a company on a topic devised by you and your supervisor. Primary and/or secondary data can be used for the purposes of the research project.
The students write a project report, which includes a literature review together with delivering an oral presentation and answering questions to a panel of academic staff.
Your placement will typically be 12 months in duration with some variation depending on the company. Most students will start their placements over the summer vacation. Each project will have an industrial supervisor, a placement supervisor and an independent panel member (IPM - a second marker). 
You will spend all of your time on the placement with the exception of required attendance at formal meetings, which are (i) the pre-placement meeting at York before the placement starts, (ii) the initial meeting at your company site 4 to 8 weeks after starting, (iii) the interim progress meeting and other activities at York in January and (iv) the final assessment meeting, including oral examination and presentation, at York in May.
Assessment of the project is based on three main areas. These areas are similar to those used for the MSci (York) research projects. During the year the Open Learning Module and the Literature Review Skills Module are also assessed.
1. Marking guidelines for project assessment (35% of placement mark, 26.25% of total year 4 mark) 
These concentrate on your ability to plan and execute a project (as well as your transferable skills, since this forms a large part of the MSci (Industry) scheme). A pro forma sheet will be used for the assessment of the project. Your industrial supervisor’s comments concerning the execution of your project will be used by the York placement supervisor to assess the project. Please note that it is your placement supervisor who will allocate your marks, not your industrial supervisor. The marks for the whole year cohort may be subject to adjustment by a moderation panel appointed by the Year 4 Committee during week 9 of Term 12.
2. Oral presentation and examination (25% of placement mark, 18.75% of total year 4 mark) 
This is held in York in week 7 of the summer term. The Assessment Panel will consist of your placement supervisor (who will chair the meeting) and your IPM. You will give a presentation lasting for no longer than 20 minutes on your project work. The presentation content is largely up to you, but it should contain an introduction, a discussion of the approach taken, the presentation of results, conclusions and future work. Following the presentation, a 30-40 minute oral examination will take place where you will be expected to answer questions on your presentation. The questions will examine not only your understanding of the project but also your knowledge of interdisciplinary principles across the range of the subject; accordingly, the questions may only be tenuously connected with your project. You are strongly advised to revise the whole of your course (years 1 to 4) in advance of your oral examination. Each member of the assessment panel will make an independent assessment of your performance and marks will be collated by the placement supervisor at the end of the assessment.
3. Project report (40% of placement mark, 30% of total year 4 mark) 
Your report should be between 4500 and 6500 words, excluding the literature review, and the experimental section, contents, figures, tables, titles and references. A word count should be included at the front of your report, and projects over the word limit will be penalised at a rate of 5 marks per 500 words up to a maximum penalty of 15 marks",,https://www.york.ac.uk/,https://www.york.ac.uk/students/studying/manage/programmes/module-catalogue/module/CHE00038M/2021-22,

In a more general context, a wider aim is to develop an enhanced ability to interpret experimental data and to design new experiments to test hypotheses.
Reaction intermediates lie at the heart of reaction mechanisms. The first evidence of their role often comes from product studies and indirect experiments which suggest their existence, but the latest techniques also enable us to study these short-lived species directly. Methods for studying intermediates include generating them as fast as they are destroyed, trapping them during their reactions, monitoring them over very short time scales, and modelling their behaviour using computational chemistry.
The module focuses on condensed-phase reactions whose mechanisms involve the formation of short-lived intermediates. It includes a wide variety of examples chosen from inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, and biochemistry, and a detailed consideration of spectroscopic techniques used to study their structure and reactivity.

University of York,UOY,Computer Science,Advanced Topics in Safety - COM00164M,10,,"In this module, we will consider the challenges posed to safety engineering techniques and praxis by Robotics and Autonomous Systems in three broad areas: technical, engineering and social. Among the technical challenges, we will explore the nature of decision-making technologies and will consider the implications for data management, model learning, verification and deployment and understanding of the interaction between AS and the 'outside world', including humans. Engineering challenges include the elicitation and validation of safety requirements, identifying and analysing new classes of hazard and understanding how failures propagate in systems with an autonomous component, implications for incident report and investigation etc.. Social challenges include the role and expectations of the human in interactions with RAS, ethical concerns, acceptance and communication of risk and challenges for the law, governance and regulatory regimes in a number of domains. Implications for the safety case, particularly with reference to machine understanding and decision-making, will be considered throughout the module. 
The module will be taught in a blended fashion, using a combination of pre-recorded lectures and live exercises sessions in which students will be taught in small groups. After the taught part of the module, students will select a topic and conduct a short critical literature review (formative). They will use this as a basis for a short talk, in a small group session, on which they will receive feedback both from other members of the group and from the course tutor. There will also be an open assessment (summative), undertaken over 7 weeks following the taught part of the module.","Foundations of System Safety Engineering (COM00006M)

University of York,UOY,Computer Science,Constraint Programming - COM00159M,10,,"Constraint programming is a collection of techniques for solving discrete optimisation problems. In general, discrete optimisation problems have a set of decisions that must be made (for example, to decide on the start times of tasks in a project scheduling problem). Usually the decisions have to satisfy some hard constraints (e.g. two tasks that use the same machine can't overlap). Also there is often some criteria to optimise: for example, the total length of time to complete all tasks. Examples of discrete optimisation include problems in timetabling, scheduling, allocation, planning, configuration, layout and routing.

It is organised into two components, Game Design Principles and Applied Game Design Research, each assessed separately. Game Design Principles uses rapid experimental making and critiquing of analogue games to introduce key concepts, components, and methods of game design and train creative skills. Applied Game Design Research combines lectures, discussion, and an applied game design sprint to engage students in critical reflection on how games affect change in desired and undesired ways, and introduces them to the use of applied game design frameworks to develop an applied game for a societal issue.",,https://www.york.ac.uk/,https://www.york.ac.uk/students/studying/manage/programmes/module-catalogue/module/COM00160M/2021-22,

University of York,UOY,Computer Science,"Identity, Trust, Reputation & Their Applications - COM00094M",10,,"Identity, Trust, and Reputation have always been core concepts in society. Society has evolved a variety of mechanisms and general approaches to support them. However, with the ever-increasing shift to digital systems, there has been a need to reinterpret these concepts. We might legitimately ask: Who do you say you are and why should I believe you? Given you are who you say you are, why should I deal with you anyway? Why should I believe what you tell me? How should I use my (and others') past experiences of dealing with you to infer something about your future (mis)behaviour? Assuming we can answer such questions, what is then facilitated?
The aim of the module is to provide understanding of how we might seek to develop systems that allow us to answer these questions on a principled basis.
The module covers technical and non-technical aspects. For example, achieving anonymity in a system is a highly technical affair, but the goal of anonymity may be highly contentious (raising issues of accountability and privacy, views on which differ between cultures and between individuals within specific cultures). In addition, as digital devices have proliferated, the user has become an integral part of many systems and has emerged as a prime target for attack. Thus, the module addresses issues such as the users' awareness of false claims of identity and their ability to identify such claims.",,,"At the end of the module the student will:
Understand the importance of identity, trust, reputation and related concepts and why they are needed.
Understand how these concepts are interpreted and implemented in modern-day systems and applications.
Be able to identify major threats to identity, trust and reputation in a variety of system types.
Be able to assess the relative merits of specific solution approaches for particular contexts.
Be able to analyse various authentication mechanisms.
Be able to set identification and authentication requirements in an informed matter and be able to assess the quality of solutions proffered by third parties.
Be aware of leading edge research in the identified areas of interest and the challenges faced.","

University of York,UOY,Computer Science,Intelligent Systems 2: Machine Learning & Optimisation - COM00024I,20,,"This module advances the IS stream by introducing the basics of machine learning, purely from an optimisation perspective. The range of topics covers linear regression (picking up where Data 1 left off) to decision trees and a simple neural network (leading into advanced machine learning in the third year). Understanding ML requires knowledge of some mathematical concepts that build upon A-level standard mathematics, specifically: Linear Algebra and Continuous Optimisation. This will be taught in-place. Students will see motivating real world problems, the ML techniques required to solve them, the underlying mathematics needed for the technique and their practical implementation. Practicals will be taught using a python-based modern machine learning library such as TensorFlow or PyTorch and so students will gain experience with the declarative programming paradigm (building on the Software stream).",,,"I201

",,"The Methods and Data Module provides the interdisciplinary skills students need to be successful and responsible researchers working with games.
This module has two components: Research Methods and Game Analytics and Responsible Innovation, each of which is assessed separately.
The Research Methods component trains students in qualitative and quantitative games research methods, including reproducibility, open science, and the use of York’s extensive facilities for eye-tracking, brain imaging, and physiological data capture. Joint critique of papers outside the students’ home disciplines develops a shared appreciation for differing epistemologies across disciplines. Students are assessed on a research paper reporting game data collected and analysed by them.
In the Game Analytics and Responsible Innovation component, students work with large games industry data sets, for example Dota 2, to learn principles of data wrangling, exploration, prediction, machine learning, and data visualisation in week 1. Using innovative methods like design fiction, students will then extrapolate potential ethical and societal ramifications of such games research work (e.g. security, privacy), and apply responsible innovation frameworks like AREA to unpack how they can anticipate, reflect, and engage with these ramifications in their work.

In addition to the lectures and workshops, it is envisaged that each student will receive up to an hour's discussion time with the supervisor (in three 20-minute meetings) during preparation of the critical evaluation report.
There will be 10 1-hour lectures, as follows:
Identifying and Reading Literature (2 lectures)
Different kinds of literature and their purposes
Search skills - search engines, search terms, initial identification of candidate literature, pitfalls
Interactive reading - specialist dictionaries, notetaking, precis
Critical Evaluation (1 lecture)
Assessing relevance, significance and quality

Writing Skills for Engineers and Scientists (3 lectures)
Audiences and Intentions - different kinds of writing (press release, oral presentation, project report, literature review, executive summary, industrial report)
Planning your work
Keeping yourself writing - motivation, organisation and writer's block
Structuring an Argument
Using literature effectively to support an argument
Style - for different types of writing and different audiences, analysing how examples of good science writing and good student writing work

Appropriate referencing - IEEE Style
Turnitin
Legal, Professional and Ethical Issues for Computer Science Research (1 lecture)
Research Ethics - data storage, permissions, experimentation ethics, University process
Applied Ethics - Professional codes of ethics
Legal issues - duty of care, liability, negligence
There will also be two two-hour workshops, as follows:
Legal, Professional, Societal and Ethical Issues - group-based discussion and exercises relating to issues arising from modern applications of CS, for example implications of autonomy (development and introduction), cyber-security (privacy and surveillance), data security, safety of computer-based systems, introduction of IT in healthcare...
Presentations - each student will give a 10-minute presentation as part of a two-hour workshop, to an audience of peers. The presentation will be based on the student's critical evaluation, and will form part of the formative assessment of the module (the intention is to feed this experience into the final project presentation).

University of York,UOY,Economics and Related Studies,Applied Econometrics for Research - ECO00070M,10,,A set of specialist lectures specialising in Econometric Theory A complementary set of practical classes to teach the   implementation of applied econometrics,,,"The topics taught in Applied Econometrics for Research can change from year to year, depending on what is considered to be most relevant and up to date.  Objectives in the past year were:
1. Programme Evaluation
 Introduction to programme evaluation. Recent decades has seen a   surge in econometric methods for programme evaluation.  The   objective is to estimate the causal effect of a policy.  The course   will set out the econometric problem and detail different methods   that have been established to identify the causal parameter. Methods including experiments, natural experiments, matching,   propensity score matching, IV and difference-in-difference
2. Panel Data
 Panel data offer the scope to control for individual heterogeneity   and to model the dynamics of individual behaviour.  However the   measures of outcome used in applied microeconomics are often   qualitative or categorical. These create special problems for   estimating econometric models. This topic focuses on binary choice   models for panel data. Practical application of the methods will be   illustrated using data on health from the British Household Panel   Survey (BHPS).  GVAR.  The introduction of the panel and global VAR frameworks and   the increasing sophistication of large simulated systems provides   opportunities to analyse international linkages in unprecedented   depth. The GVAR model represents an accessible way of combining   country-specific models into a global framework without falling   victim to the dimensional problems typically associated with such   large-scale models. The ability to coherently model the global   economy and to assess the effects on a sovereign state/economic   bloc, both of global shocks and of shocks emanating from specific   countries, renders GVAR an unusually powerful tool for the analysis   of the number of macroeconomic issues. However, the considerable   volume of statistical output generated by such models introduces a   secondary curse of dimensionality, whereby the limits of the   modellers ability to process the output become a binding constraint.   We also develop a family of Generalized Connectedness Measures   (GCMs) which provide a simple means to summarise the linkages   embodied in such models non-selectively either with recourse to   geographic aggregation or aggregation into desired groups of similar variables.
3. Cross-Sectionally Correlated Data
 Spatial Econometrics: Discuss the development of the leading   models employed to handle situations in which spatially structured   interactions between observational units (spillovers or flows) are   at the core of the analysis. If time allows, both so-called spatial   autoregression models and the gravity model will be discussed, and   some model specification issues will be introduced that either are,   or should be, the subject of current research Topics on estimation and inference in some static linear panel   data models.  In this session, after briefly reviewing the famous   Fixed Effects (FE) and Random Effects (RE) estimators, we plan to   discuss various econometric methods for estimation and inference of   static linear short panel data models, which are extensions of the   FE and RE models.
